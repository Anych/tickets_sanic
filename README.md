# My project for Chocotravel/Aviata companies

My name is Anuarbek Umarov. I'm a python bootcamp participant. 

This is my first project using Sanic framework. 

Instructions for run the project:

1. Crete network for app use command: docker network create app-platform
2. Run docker compose use command: docker-compose up --build

Hope I can apply for a job after this challenge.

Thank you for your attention!
